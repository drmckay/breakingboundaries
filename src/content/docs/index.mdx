## Research areas

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Process boundary" icon="setting">
		A process boundary isolates each process’s memory and resources, preventing interference from other processes.
	</Card>
	<Card title="AppContainer boundary" icon="setting">
		An AppContainer-based sandbox process cannot access or tamper with code and data outside of the sandbox based on the container capabilities.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Session boundary" icon="seti:clock">
		A session boundary isolates user sessions, ensuring processes and data in one session cannot interfere with or access those in another.
	</Card>
	<Card title="User boundary" icon="document">
		A user boundary isolates each user's data, settings, and processes, preventing unauthorized access between users.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Kernel boundary" icon="rocket">
		A kernel boundary separates user-mode processes from the kernel, restricting direct access to critical system resources.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Virtual Machine boundary" icon="rocket">
		An unauthorized Hyper-V guest virtual machine cannot access or tamper with the code and data of another guest virtual machine; this includes Hyper-V Isolated Containers.

	<Card title="Virtualization-Based Security (VBS) Boundary" icon="shield">
		Data and code within a VBS Trustlet or Enclave cannot be accessed or tampered with by code executing outside of the VBS Trustlet or Enclave if not explicitly shared.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Virtual Secure Mode (VSM) Boundary" icon="shield">
		Data and code marked as private within a Virtual Trust Level (VTL) cannot be accessed or tampered with by code executing inside a lower VTL.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Web Browser Boundary" icon="browser">
